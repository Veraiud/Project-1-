- Challenge Type: **Team** 

## Perform penetration testing on a web application and monitor for security incidents using SOC practices

## Roles and Setup

1. **PC 1: Web Application Server**

- Hosts the target web application that you will be testing.You can choose https://github.com/webpwnized/mutillidae
- Runs a web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx) with a sample vulnerable web application (e.g., DVWA or OWASP Juice Shop).
- Should have a database server (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) if the web application requires it.

- The machine from which you will perform the penetration testing.
- Runs Kali Linux or Parrot Security OS, equipped with tools like Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP, SQLmap, and Nmap.

- If you want to separate the database server from the web application server for a more realistic setup.
- Hosts the database used by the web application.
- Runs a database management system like MySQL or PostgreSQL.

4. **PC 4: Monitoring and Logging Server**

- Used for monitoring network traffic and logging activities during the penetration test.
- Runs tools like Wireshark for network traffic capture, and Splunk for logging and analysis.

5. **Documentation**

- Detailed configuration.
- Provide the pentesting report.
- Provide Incident Report.
- Response Plan: Develop an incident response plan and report the timeline for detected attacks.
